## Coding: ChatGPT API

Clone the example project: https://github.com/neuefische/java-chatgpt-based-cooking-ingredients

Implement the [IngredientController](https://github.com/bartfastiel/chatgpt-based-cooking-ingredients/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/chatgptbasedcookingingredients/IngredientController.java) so that it determines "vegan", "vegetarian", or "regular" for an ingredient.

Feel free to use the code examples in the handout as a reference. Another example can be found here: https://github.com/bartfastiel/chatgpt-api-reiseapp

## Bonus: Cooking Instructions

If you still have time, you can try your hand at a cooking instruction. Let ChatGPT create a cooking instruction for a dish with the given list of ingredients in another controller.

The result object should contain a title, description, and list of ingredients.
